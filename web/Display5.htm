					It seemed that out of battle <strong>I</strong> escaped<br />
					Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped<br />
					Through granites which titanic wars had groined.<br />
				</p><p>
					Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned,<br />
					Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred.<br />
					Then, as <strong>I</strong> probed them, one sprang up, and stared<br />
					With piteous recognition in fixed eyes,<br />
					Lifting distressful hands, as if to bless.<br />
					And by his smile, <strong>I</strong> knew that sullen hall,---<br />
					By his dead smile <strong>I</strong> knew we stood in Hell.<br />
				</p><p>
					With a thousand pains that vision's face was grained;<br />
					Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground,<br />
					And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan.<br />
					Strange friend, <strong>I</strong> said, here is no cause to mourn.<br />
					'None,' said that other, 'save the undone years,<br />
					The hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours,<br />
					Was my life also; <strong>I</strong> went hunting wild<br />
					After the wildest beauty in the world,<br />
					Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair,<br />
					But mocks the steady running of the hour,<br />
					And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here.<br />
					For by my glee might many men have laughed,<br />
					And of my weeping something had been left,<br />
					Which must die now. <strong>I</strong> mean the truth untold,<br />
					The pity of war, the pity war distilled.<br />
					Now men will go content with what we spoiled,<br />
					Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled.<br />
					They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress.<br />
					None will break ranks, though nations trek from progress.<br />
					Courage was mine, and <strong>I</strong> had mystery,<br />
					Wisdom was mine, and <strong>I</strong> had mastery:<br />
					To miss the march of this retreating world<br />
					Into vain citadels that are not walled.<br />
					Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels,<br />
					I would go up and wash them from sweet wells,<br />
					Even with truths that lie too deep for taint.<br />
					I would have poured my spirit without stint<br />
					But not through wounds; not on the cess of war.<br />
					Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were.<br />
				</p><p>
					'I am the enemy you killed, my friend.<br />
					I knew you in this dark: for so you frowned<br />
					Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed.<br />
					I parried; but my hands were loath and cold.<br />
					Let us sleep now....'<br />
